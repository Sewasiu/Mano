	<p>Hello and welcome to my first website! My name is Seva, shorter for Severina. I am a website designer in progress.

<article>The first time I heard about programming was in high school, where teachers told that to learn programming you have to know mathematics and physics really well and I knew I wasn't that. So, I decided to trust my teachers and to never look at that side. But few years went by, and I got my first computer, (yayy that was exiting!) but I thought my computer is too weak to carry heavy programs (even though I didn't know anything about that.)
